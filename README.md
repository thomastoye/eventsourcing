# Welcome!

## These notes are a work in progress

I'm learning about event sourcing. Sadly, there's no authoritative book on the subject. So I decided to collect notes and nuggets of knowledge here.

## Contributions

...are very welcome.

The repository is [here](https://github.com/thomastoye/eventsourcing). I use the GitBook app to author the Markdown, but pure MD should work too.
